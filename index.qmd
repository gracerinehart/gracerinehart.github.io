Hello! My name is Grace Rinehart, and I'm a 3rd year student at CSU. I'm majoring in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability with a minor in Restoration Ecology. I'm very passionate about the environment, and my ultimate goal is to help restore and protect ecosystems. I would describe myself as hardworking, collaborative, and kind. I want this site to serve as a place where I can show my professional and educational experiences. I hope that my site serves as a tool for future employers and colleagues to learn more about me and my skills.
